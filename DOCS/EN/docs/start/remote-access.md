I refer you to the [Frequently Asked Questions - FAQ](/start/faq) first.

## VPN
With a VPN like [Wireguard](/software/wireguard) you can lay a virtual cable to your home network and thus access your home network securely (tunneled) from anywhere.

## Reverse Proxy
With a reverse proxy, you can redirect all your programs that are locally running, for example on http://192.168.178.20:3000, to a domain https://deinprogramm.deine-domain.de.

### NGinx Proxy Manager
The [NGinx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) is an easy way to set up such a proxy. Installation takes place via Docker and a template is provided via the script.

### Traefik
The [Traefik Reverse Proxy](/software/traefik) is a bit more complex to set up, but can be automated very well. I have written a guide for this purpose.


## SSH
