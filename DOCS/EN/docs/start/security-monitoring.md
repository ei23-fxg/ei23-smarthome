# Security

Security is a big topic, so I'll only briefly touch on it for now:

- If you don't know what you're doing or are unsure, just leave it.
- As a general rule, you should only open ports outward if you know what you're doing.
- Everything according to the motto: **Only as much as necessary and as little as possible**

Regarding [Remote Access](/start/remote-access), I have already created a rough overview. 

Otherwise, I refer to the [Frequently Asked Questions - FAQ](/start/faq)

# Monitoring

With some programs, it becomes clear over time that you can't do without them anymore. Therefore, it is important to monitor whether the program is running properly. When problems occur, you can react quickly or automatically execute actions. There are various services for this, such as [Uptime Kuma](/software/uptimekuma).
But even here, the solutions are very individual and the principle "Learning by Doing" applies.
