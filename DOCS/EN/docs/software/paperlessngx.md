# Paperless-NGX

Paperless-NGX is a free document management software with text recognition (OCR).
[docs.paperless-ngx.com](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/)
It provides an elegant solution for digitizing paper documents and consolidating their digital counterparts in PDF or image formats. There are apps available, making it a truly helpful tool for managing paperwork.
I now scan everything that comes in directly and simply place it in a box. In theory, I could even burn the paper (but I don't have a fireplace). I also directly import PDF files, keeping everything in one place.
Therefore, Paperless-NGX is an integral part of my SmartHome script.
